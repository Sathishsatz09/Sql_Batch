Global temporary tables are accessible from other connection contexts. 
Both local temporary and global temporary tables reside in the tempdatabase.

2.What is CHECK constraint? 
Answer: CHECK constraint will use while creating the table, its used to check the condition what we are giving the 
condition to the column. then if condition is true it will allow the data to store in the table. example (empsalary money CHECK <100000)

3.What is a Trigger? 
Answer: Trigger function is used to block the Data definition language, Data manipulation language operations, 
it will not allow to create,delete,update,alter,drop & insert if we trigger the specific operations.
